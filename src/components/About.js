                        <p> My name is Omar Cossio. I am originally from Mexico City, Mexico,
                        but grew up in Asheboro, NC. I moved to Charlotte, NC in 2011, and love it.
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            I graduated from Johnson C. Smith University in 2016 and currently I am studying at The Coding Bootcamp at UNC Charlotte, where I'm working to become a full-stack developer.
                                                </p>
